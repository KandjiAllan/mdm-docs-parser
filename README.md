# MDM Yaml Docs -> JSON Schema

The goal of this project is to convert all MDM Docs, specified in YAML, into
JSON Schema. The benefit to this conversion is the freedom to convert the
resulting JSON Schema into a sleu of different types, ex. TypeScript, Zod, etc.

The motivation for this, over manually writing the schemas is that in these schemas change fairly frequently and nobody wants to have to come back and manually go through this documentation.
